# Android development and testing

The `android/` project contains the gateway app and local tests. Build and check it with JDK 21:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew :app:lintDebug :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:assembleDebug --no-daemon
```

On Windows, use `gradlew.bat`. The app needs a compatible Android device, an active SIM, and the permissions presented in the app to exercise SMS behavior. Emulator and JVM tests cover protocol and local-state behavior; they cannot verify a carrier send or receipt.

When reporting device behavior, include the model, Android version, app revision, power state, network type, SIM state, and the action taken. Test reconnects after screen-off, network changes, reboot, permission changes, and app upgrades. Use only a phone and recipient you control, and remove personal numbers and message bodies from logs and issues. A successful callback is evidence of the corresponding platform event; it does not make all future deliveries reliable.

The [device-stream contract](../protocol/v1/device-stream.md) documents the authenticated connection. The [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) explains why an ambiguous radio attempt remains unknown rather than being automatically resent.
